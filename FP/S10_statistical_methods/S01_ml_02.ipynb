    "\n",
    "a) Determine the maximum-likelihood estimate $\\hat a$ of the parameter $a$ and its uncertainty from the provided data sample using a numerical minimization tool, e.g., `iminuit` (see comments below).\n",
    "\n",
    "b) Plot the histogram representation of the data along with the fit function.\n",

    "\n",
    "Compare your result with the result of `iminuit`'s `minos()` routine. Reduce the sample size of the data set by only taking the first $n$ events (`x[:n]`). At approximately which value of $n$ is the difference between $\\sigma_a^-$ and $\\sigma_a^+$ bigger than 5\\%? \n",
    "\n",
    "Use the data generation provided in the notebook `S01_ml_02_generate_data.ipynb`. It is recommended to actually generate a `CSV` file and read it back here. You don't necessarily have to hand in your generated data; the tutors can generate their own and since your implemented procedure is generic, it should work with any other dataset generated with `S01_ml_02_generate_data.ipynb`.\n",

    "### Hints\n",
    "\n",
    "It is recommended to not start coding right away. Try to really understand how the Likelihood looks first. Realize, what the Likelihood is a function of and what it describes.\n",

    "The KIP service has iminuit version 1.3.8. Please note that the most recent version is $\\geq2.0.0$ and that the [documentation](https://iminuit.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) applies to *that* version. Some backward-incompatible changes have been introduced, some of which changed some interfaces. For your tasks that mainly affects the `minuit.Minuit` constructor. The following shows the construction of a `Minuit` object for version 1.3.8 (in case you use the KIP service or a version $<2.0.0$) and $\\geq2.0.0$ (in case you use another service implementing a higher version), respectively.\n",

    "Another (potenitally) Jupiter related *feature* is the fact that `m.migrad()`, `m.matrix()`, `m.minos()` etc. can yield a nice summary of the respective procedure. However, in order to show it, either of these methods (and potentially others in case you use them) have to be *the last line of a code cell*. If there is *anything* coming afterwards, the output will not be printed, hence, for anything that follows, it is recommended to start a new code cell."
