# Heidelberg University – BSc Physics Practicals

This repository contains code and supporting materials for various physics practicals completed during the BSc Physics program at Heidelberg University.

## 📁 Folder Structure

### `FP/` – Advanced Physics Practicals  
This folder includes code for eight advanced practical experiments. The code is written in either **Python** (Jupyter Notebooks) or **C++**.  
For the experiments **S10 – Statistical Methods** and **F95 – Medical Physics**, full protocols (special writeups) are also included.

### `PAP/` – Introductory Physics Practicals  
This folder contains protocols for all of the second part introductory experiments (PAP 2).  
At the end of each protocol, you’ll find the associated **Python (Jupyter Notebook)** code used for analysis.

## 🧪 Languages & Tools Used
- Python (Jupyter Notebooks)
- C++
- LaTeX (for protocol writeups)
